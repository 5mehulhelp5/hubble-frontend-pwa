# Platform: Shopware
Contains all files that are related to usage of hubble PWA with Shopware 6.

## api-client
The API Client for this platform is generated by https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen.

### Generate
To generate / update the client:
1. Create a Shopware Integration (required only once per setup) https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/settings/system/integrationen
2. Set credentials as cli env variables
```shell
export BASEURL=http://localhost
export CLIENT_ID=your-shopware-client-id
export CLIENT_SECRET=your-shopware-client-secret
```
3. Run helper cli script
```shell
npm run sw:dev:generate-api
```

### Patch
Because the client is generated from the swagger comments of shopware, there can be mismatches in types or functions. 
Patch files are applied automatically on client generation. 
In this case you can patch missing or wrong code on your own:

1. Change to root directory
2. Commit your changes to git 
3. Create patch:
```shell
export $COMMIT=commit-hash-from-1
npm run sw:dev:patch-api
```
4. Commit generated path file to git 

### Usage
Use api client directly in platform specific composables only to keep backend agnostic.
Given services can be found in shopware/api-client/generated/services
```js
import { CategoryShopware } from '../api-client/generated'

const { data, pending, refresh } = await CategoryShopware.readNavigation(
    'main-navigation',
    'main-navigation',
    {},
    true
)
```

### Custom request.ts
- sets shopware specific default headers: **sw-access-key** and **sw-include-seo-urls**
- sets shopware specific header **sw-context-token** if exists as cookie or in store 
- uses useFetch function of Nuxt 3 to resolve with: data, pending, refresh
- handles errors 

## bin
Contains shopware specific cli helper like api client generation.

## composables
Contains shopware specific composables. Mostly used to fetch data from api via 
platform specific api client and map them to types / interfaces defined in /runtime/commons. 

## .env_example
